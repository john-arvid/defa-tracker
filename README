A script that sends requests to the Defa API getting the location and sends the location to traccar in homeassistant.

I traced the network package from the IOS app to be able to reconstruct my requests. Needs to be done for each user since there are some unique identifiers.
The example file shows how the payload and url is built, and this needs to be changed for each user.
